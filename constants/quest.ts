export const QUEST_DIFFICULTY_EXPLANATION = `The difficulty level corresponds to the duration of the quest. Higher difficulty means you will have to commit to your goal for a longer period, but earn more rewards at the end.

Easy: Commitment of 1 week
Medium: Commitment of 2 weeks
Hard: Commitment of 1 month

If you fail to hit your weekly gym targets, the quest will end, regardless of your progress, and you won't receive any experience points or rewards.

We recommend starting with the easy difficulty and gradually progressing to harder difficulties as you establish a regular gym routine.
